# VimFile
  This repository is mean to store the vim setting in my curretn machine, in case of losing the setting of vim, and needs to re-configure again. I have been through this once, never make the stupid mistake again.
  Also, there maybe some other file for other purpose, this is mean to be a personal repository.
